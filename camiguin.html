  	<h1 id="intro" style="text-align: center">Camiguin</h1>
	<p>Camiguin is a small and peaceful island province in the Philippines located in the Bohol Sea off the 
	northern coast of Mindanao. It may be the smallest island in Mindanao and the second smallest province in 
	the Philippines, but it has surprisingly a lot of tourist spots to offer.</p>

	<p>Dubbed the “Island Born of Fire,” Camiguin is home to seven volcanoes that continue to shape and reshape 
	its unique landscape.</p>

	<p>The interior forest reserves known as Mount Hibok-Hibok Protected Landscape have been declared an ASEAN 
	Heritage Park. But for beach lovers, it’s the water-based attractions that make Camiguin special.</p>

	<p>This compact island also hides numerous waterfalls, natural springs, unspoiled beaches and diving spots 
	that will please adventurous travelers. Camiguin is home to a mysterious Sunken Cemetery which continues to 
	fascinate travelers from all over the world.</p>

	<p>For history buffs, there are interesting Camiguin tourist spots you can visit including several well-
	preserved ancestral houses, Spanish-era churches and heritage sites scattered around the island.</p>

	<p>Camiguin is also famous for its sweet lanzones fruits for which an annual festival is dedicated.</p>

	<p>Geographically part of Region 10 or Northern Mindanao, Camiguin was formerly a part of the Misamis 
	Oriental. This province is tiny compared to neighboring provinces in the mainland region and it maintains 
	the same laidback beach vibe similar to top island-hopping destinations in the Philippines such as Bohol 
	and Siquijor.</p>

	<p>It may not have the vibrant party scene and nightlife found in other bigger island destinations like 
	Boracay and Siargao, but Camiguin offers a very safe and peaceful getaway. It’s still a bit off-the-
	beaten-path for travelers, but first-time travelers will enjoy the unspoiled sights and local 
	hospitality.</p>

	<p>While traveling around Mindanao, be sure to include a Camiguin tour in your itinerary. Here are just some 
	of the best tourist spots in the province you can visit.
